> Bot adding reply comments with links to appropriate responses found on [/r/dota2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2).

![Example](https://i.imgur.com/PAcg57z.png)

The bot replies only for the comments that **are** responses. 

For example: `"Selemene commands"` will return a Luna response *(like on the screenshot above)*. 

### Comment/Submission text processing
*   All the body text is transformed into lowercase
*   Any punctuation is replaced with spaces
*   Multiple spaces are trimmed to single space.
*   If comment has blockquote, first blockquote is considered for matching.

<!-- Old behavior
All the responses are in lowercase in the dictionary, before comparision the comments are parsed to lowercase as well. Dot or exclamation mark ending the replyable is ignored.
-->
<!-- Old behavior
The bot will try to match a response of the hero that is in the comment/submission's author flair. If it does not find an appropriate one, it takes the one of the first hero that has such a response (alphabetically).
-->

---
### TODO
*   (If possible) Add hero flair in responses (Waiting on reddit to support this in reddit redesign).

---
### Some stats and general info
[/r/dota2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2) subreddit generates around 3.5k comments/day, 
peaking around 12.5k during December (stats via [subbreditstats](https://subredditstats.com/r/dota2). 
Bot should be able to handle more than 15k comments/day(10 comments/minute) easily (Just an estimate, actual performance not yet tested).
